== Prefixes ==

Class names have been chosen to reduce the likelihood of conflicts â€” e.g. there's every chance "alert" may already be used on a website, but "xf-alert" is less likely. These prefixes have been chosen to reflect the source, or inspiration, of the semantics behind the class name.

Sometimes we name classes after elements from HTML5 (e.g. section). In this instances, we do not use a prefix.
