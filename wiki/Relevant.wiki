#summary using the "relevant" concept for progressive disclosure

= Introduction =

_Progressive disclosure_ is the display (disclosure) of sections of a form as they become (progressively) _relevant_. For example, answering a question "yes" or "no" might cause different follow questions to be asked. Progressive disclosure is the practice of showing this sections dynamically, with javascript.
