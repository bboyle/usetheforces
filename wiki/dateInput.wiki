= Introduction =

HTML5 defines date (and time) input.

= Details =

 * should implement recommended ARIA roles and keyboard support [http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#datepicker]
 * be nice to also support mousewheel scrolling (with meta keys?)
 * be nice to use jquery UI, but it does not seem to match ARIA [http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/]

The date picker could be larger than most. Might be a bit easier to use and click on. May need click affordances for navigating by months/years, and keyboard hints. Mouse focus should have highlights, like keyboard focus. Should the datepicker mask the screen like a lightbox would? The field (label, input box and datepicker) should be active.

Could use larger week names, e.g. Sun, Mon, Tues, Wed, Thurs, Fri, Sat.
