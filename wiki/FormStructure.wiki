 # Perceptual layer
 ## _Page furniture_ — everything around the form, page layout, branding, titling. Use standard HTML markup.
 ## _Instructions_ — how to make these accessible within the form remains a great challenge... do they need to be embedded within legend/label elements, or use ARIA?
 ### The first instructions, the _preamble_, should be placed before the {{{form}}} element in the HTML source.
 ## _Prompt/response pairs_ — use the forces markup and styles directly address this.
 # Conversational layer
