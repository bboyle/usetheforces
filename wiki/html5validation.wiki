#summary integration with HTML5 form validation
#labels Phase-Requirements

HTML5 specifies a validation framework for web forms.
This integrates forces with those attributes and events in order to:
 * ease migration to html5
 * implement a richer UI in browsers implementing html5 validation


= Details =


= Story HTML5-001 =

As a forces developer I want "invalid" states to be consistently handled whether they were detected and escalated by html5 validation or forces validation.

== Acceptance criteria ==
 # {{{:-xf-invalid}}} should match elements that are "invalid" by html5 definition
 # ~~{{{:-xf-required}}} should match elements with {{{@required}}}~~
