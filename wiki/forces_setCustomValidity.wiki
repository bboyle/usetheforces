#summary .forces_setCustomValidity(string) API documentation
#labels API

This functionality is borrowed from HTML5 [http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/association-of-controls-and-forms.html#dom-cva-setcustomvalidity setCustomValidity()]

= .forces_setCustomValidity() =

 * removes invalid constraint
 * removes any set alert message (validation warning)

= .forces_setCustomValidity(message) =

 * flags a control as invalid
 * sets the alert message (validation warning) to be displayed


= Examples =

see the HTML5 example. Replace _setCustomValidity()_ with _forces_setCustomValidity()_

= Notes =

Setting custom validity does not necessarily trigger the display of alerts to the user; it will flag a control as invalid and fire the invalid event, but UI updates may be delayed until triggered by a user interaction â€” e.g. focus, blur, change or submit event.
