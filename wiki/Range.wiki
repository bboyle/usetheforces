As a web developer I want to use range where available and a select list elsewhere so that I can deliver the best customer experience.

== Acceptance criteria ==
 # use progressive enhancement (select list by default, replaced by range when supported)
 # do nothing if any option contains non-numeric values: floating point and negatives allowed; ignore null values
 # specify min attribute based on the lowest option value
 # specify max attribute based on the highest option value
 # specify step attribute based on difference between two lowest values
 # specify (default) value attribute based on selected option value or the empty string
 # preserve attributes: id, class, name, title

=== Questions ===
 * What if there is only 1 value in the list? This gets converted to a range control with min and max the same, and a step of zero. This is expected behaviour, not a bug.
