Tips and tricks for using HTML's {{{legend}}} element.


= Styling =

== Reset styles ==
 * Remove margins/padding
 * Allow text wrapping
 * Reset text colour (older versions of IE use blue for legend text)

{{{
legend {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  white-space: normal;
  *color: #000;
  *margin-left: -5px;
  *margin-right -5px;
}
}}}

== Styling legends as headings ==
When using fieldsets to represent sections of a form, the {{{legend}}} takes on the role of a heading. Styling it {{{bold}}} is straightforward. Using backgrounds or borders can be tricky, particularly in gecko browsers where the legend will not stretch to utilise the available width (no matter what you do).

=== Using a line under the heading ===
Usually {{{border-bottom}}} would suffice, however gecko will appear to cut the border short. Assuming the element after the legend is a block element, you can use this css:
{{{
legend + * {
  border-top: 1px solid #000;
}
}}}
This applies a {{{border-top}}} to siblings of {{{legend}}} elements, which works in gecko and all browsers supporting CSS2 selectors.

IE6 does not support the sibling selector '{{{+}}}', so the above rule is ignored. However, IE6 can apply a {{{border-bottom}}} on {{{legend}}} just fine. 

{{{
legend {
  _border-bottom: 1px solid #000;
}
}}}

Yep, it means specifying the border twice. But it works.
