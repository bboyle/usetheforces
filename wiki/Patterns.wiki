Patterns for web forms will be used in this project to frame the decisions made and the products delivered.

Of particular interest are patterns that determine the structure of forms (form components, and perhaps the order they appear in, which are optional/mandatory and under what circumstances); and all those same questions answered again for key components - such as a typical form element, aka prompt: response, question? answer. That kind of thing.
