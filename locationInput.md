# Introduction #

I want to collect the user's location, somewhat accurately.


# Design considerations #

  * allow the user to type their location
  * use the geolocation API
  * possible to provide both coordinates and friendly (human readable) names?
  * work from broader dataâ€”specifically in Australia, work from postcode to a location name
  * confirmation via map and/or address
  * respect user privacy
  * be accessible and backwards compatible
