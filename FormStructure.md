# Introduction #

Building on the work of Caroline Jarrett, Designing usable forms: the three-layer model of the form … describing what markup to use to structure forms and maximize usability.

# Details #

  1. Perceptual layer
    1. _Page furniture_ — everything around the form, page layout, branding, titling. Use standard HTML markup.
    1. _Instructions_ — how to make these accessible within the form remains a great challenge... do they need to be embedded within legend/label elements, or use ARIA?
      1. The first instructions, the _preamble_, should be placed before the `form` element in the HTML source.
    1. _Prompt/response pairs_ — use the forces markup and styles directly address this.
  1. Conversational layer
  1. Relationship layer
